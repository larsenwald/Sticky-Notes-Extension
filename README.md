# Sticky Notes Chrome Extension

Welcome to my Sticky Notes Chrome Extension! This is a little project I built because I've been reading a lot of online textbooks and articles, and I've been wanting a way to leave sticky notes on webpages that don’t vanish when I close the tab or refresh the page. All the bookmarking tools I looked into didn't let me jot down my thoughts directly on the page, so I figured I'd create something **simple** that would feel as natural as sticking a Post-it on a book or a monitor.

So, I decided to create this extension! 📝


## What It Does

- **Sticky Notes That Stick**: Add a sticky note anywhere on a webpage, and it stays tied to that page—even if you close the tab and come back later.
- **Position Memory**: The notes stay exactly where you left them, no matter where you scrolled.
- **Movable and Resizable**: Drag or resize notes as needed.
- **➕ and 🗑️ Buttons**: Quickly add new notes or delete ones you no longer need.
- **Simple Design**: No clutter, just functional sticky notes.


## Known Issues

This extension is still evolving! For a list of known limitations and planned fixes, check the [Issues tab](https://github.com/larsenwald/Sticky-Notes-Extension/issues).


## How to Use It

### Install the Extension:
1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP.
2. Load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome. 
   - Go to `chrome://extensions`, enable "Developer Mode," and click "Load unpacked."

### Add and Manage Notes:
- Click the extension icon to create a note in the center of the screen.
- Use the `➕` button on a note to add another nearby.
- Drag the header to move notes or resize them using the bottom-right corner.
- Delete individual notes with the 🗑️ button or clear all notes via the `...` menu.


## What's In the Code

This extension is built using:
- **JavaScript** and **CSS** for functionality and styling, respectively.
- **Chrome Extension API**: The magic that lets the notes persist across tabs and sessions.

Everything is modular and easy to understand (I hope). If you’re a developer, feel free to poke around the code and improve it. I’d love to hear what you think!


## How to Get Involved

I made this project mostly for myself, but it’s open for anyone who wants to use or contribute to it. If you want to:
1. **Report Bugs**: Found something that doesn’t work? Open an issue, and I’ll do my best to fix it.
2. **Suggest Features**: Have an idea that would make this even better? Let me know, and I’ll see what I can do.
3. **Contribute**: If you’re a developer, feel free to fork the repo, make improvements, and submit a pull request.


## Closing Thoughts

This extension was born out of a small annoyance that turned into a fun little coding journey. It’s simple, functional, and (I think) pretty cool. If you’re someone who loves reading online and wants a lightweight way to take notes, I hope this extension makes your life a little easier.

Thanks for checking it out, and happy note-taking! ✨
