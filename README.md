# Sticky Notes Chrome Extension

Welcome to my Sticky Notes Chrome Extension!

This is a little project I built because I've been reading a lot of online textbooks and articles, and I've been wanting a way to leave sticky notes on webpages that don‚Äôt vanish when I close the tab or refresh the page. All the bookmarking tools I looked into didn't let me jot down my thoughts directly on the page, so I figured I'd create something **simple** that would feel as natural as sticking a Post-it on a book or a monitor.

## What It Does

- **Sticky Notes That Stick**: Add a sticky note anywhere on a webpage, and it stays tied to that page‚Äîeven if you close the tab and come back later.
- **Position Memory**: The notes stay exactly where you left them, no matter where you scrolled.
- **Movable and Resizable**: Drag or resize notes as needed.
- **‚ûï and üóëÔ∏è Buttons**: Quickly add new notes or delete ones you no longer need.
- **Simple Design**: No clutter, just functional sticky notes.

## Known Issues

## How to Use It

### Install the Extension:

1. Clone this repository or download it as a ZIP.
2. Load it as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

## What's In the Code

This extension is built using:

- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**.
- **Chrome Extension API**.

Everything is modular and easy to understand (I hope). If you‚Äôre a developer, feel free to poke around the code and improve it. I‚Äôd love to hear what you think!

## How to Get Involved

I made this project mostly for myself, but it‚Äôs open for anyone who wants to use or contribute to it. If you want to:

1. **Report Bugs**: Please, if you come across something that doesn't work, open an issue and I'll fix it ASAP.
2. **Suggest Features**: Have an idea that would make this even better? Open an issue and I'll see what I can do.
3. **Contribute**: If you‚Äôre a developer, feel free to fork the repo, make improvements, and submit a pull request.

## Enjoy!

This extension was born out of a small annoyance that turned into a fun little coding journey. It‚Äôs simple, functional, and (I think) pretty cool. If you‚Äôre someone who loves reading online and wants a lightweight way to take notes, I hope this extension makes your life a little easier. I'm constantly iterating it, so be sure to check back for updates.

Thanks for checking it out, and happy note-taking! üìù‚ú®
